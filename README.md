# Crypto currency trading platform

A full-stack web application that streams real-time cryptocurrency prices from https://tradingview.com. The application will consist of a Node.js backend and a Next.js frontend.

## To run the project

1.  Run `pnpm install --recursive` to install all dependencies.
2.  Run `./run.sh` to launch the application.
    - This single script should handle all necessary steps, including code generation (e.g., `buf generate`) and starting both the frontend and backend servers.
3.  Open `http://localhost:3000` in a web browser.
4.  Test the functionality by adding and removing various tickers.
